## This is a Heading h2 
### This is a Heading h3


# Emphasis

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
~~This will be crossed out~~

_You **can** ~~combine~~ them_

# Blockquotes

As Jacob Lett said:

> Learning HTML and CSS is a lot more challenging 
> then it used to be. Responsive web design adds more layers

# Task Lists

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

# Tables

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

# Inline code

I think you should use an `<form>` element instead
